# Digiform web

The digiform-web directory contains a complete front-end setup for the web implementation of the DigiForm solution. The system is implemented using the Angular 2 framework in cooperation with Python Django backend solutions. For styling purposes we have used Bulma, a modern CSS framework based on flexbox. 

## Quickstart:
- Run local server through digiform-api
- Go to the digiform-web directory
- Type the command "npm run server"
